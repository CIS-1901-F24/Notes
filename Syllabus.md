# Course Policies

-   The standard [academic integrity rules](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/) apply. In addition, do not copy code. You or your assignment partner should write all of the code. Low-level (e.g. syntax) and high-level (e.g. language concepts) discussions are fine, including with other pairs at your table.
    
-   Do not post your assignment solutions publicly (Github, personal website, etc.), even after the course ends. You can post your final project code, though.
    
-   The use of AI tools (such as ChatGPT) to solve entire assignments is not allowed. The course material is introductory and may be solvable using these tools. For the best learning experience, we encourage you to solve the assignments on your own. However, you are allowed to ask syntactic and conceptual questions using these tools.
